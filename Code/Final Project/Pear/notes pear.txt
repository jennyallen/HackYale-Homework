	notes
		cutoff time 7pm day before
			release times by email at 7:05
		don't pair people already paired with before for x times
			expect people to reach out themselves
		end goal is	no one uses our app, when everyone knows each other
		commons has extra hours
		bay gross ldap and cas
			https://gist.github.com/baygross/2054898
		don't yet need user's list of classes, unless seminar pairing
		default opening should be same as last week, or if null, then from group MWF or TTh
		progress bar
		
	idea
		simple, spontaneous way for yalies to get to know each other
		have snarky, sassy tone
		like binpack, need optimal solution with fewest people left out
		Silence is golden, except when it's you sitting by yourself at lunch. If you're looking to meet new Yalies or make lifelong everlasting perpetualastic friendships, Slackline is for you. Give your availability and Slackline will randomly pair you with another lonely stoner for lunch. Peace.

	future
		have user id photos be randomized animals
		when pairing made, send random weird conversation topic
		groups of 3

Andrew Goldstein: As Aaron mentioned, an app for this (called LunchtYme) is being created. I would say that it is 70 percent done, with a beautiful and simple user interface. If any of you would like to help with this - coding in ruby on rails or promoting it on campus - please contact me directly!
